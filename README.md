## Motivation
Recommendation engines are one of the most important data science applications in use today. Data science is being used to recommend everything from music & movies to friends and new destinations. The three main branches of recommenders are:

- Knowledge-Based : recommendation in which knowledge about the item or user preferences are used to make a recommendation.Eg. Flipkart,Myntra.
- Content-Based : recommendations based only on the interactions between users and items.Eg. Netflix.
- Collaborative Filtering :  when we use information about the users or items to assist in our recommendations.Eg. AirBnB,Youtube.

## Overview
In this Project, I analyse the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles. In future iterations, I will apply content-based recommendations and try contributing to its recommender system.

## Data
There are two types of data. One contains user-item info, like which user read which article, and another is articles’ info (like description, title and body content).

## Python Library Used 
 - Pandas
 - Numpy
 - Scipy
 - Scikit-learn
 - Matplotlib
## Accuracy
